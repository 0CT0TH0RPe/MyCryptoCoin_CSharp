// IConsensusContract.cs
// Purpose: This interface extends the ISmartContract interface and defines methods specifically for consensus contracts.
// Implementation: The methods in this interface will be used by consensus-related contracts to perform their functionality. These methods should be designed to execute the consensus logic embedded in the contracts.

/*
In this example, the `IConsensusContract` interface defines methods for selecting a consensus protocol based on the transaction type, transferring funds, and executing custom actions. The `TransactionType` and `ActionType` enums are used to provide context for the operations.

Remember that this is a basic outline, and you can further customize the interface to match your application's needs. Additionally, you would have corresponding implementations of these methods in your `ConsensusContract.cs` class that delegates the actual work to the selected consensus protocol based on the transaction type or action.

Certainly! The `IConsensusContract.cs` interface plays a crucial role in providing a standardized way for clients (end-users) of your MyCryptoCoin application to interact with various consensus protocols based on their specific needs. Let's break down the key components of the `IConsensusContract.cs` interface:

1. **Interface Purpose**:
   The `IConsensusContract` interface acts as a contract or agreement that defines a set of methods that clients can use to interact with different consensus protocols. It encapsulates the logic of selecting the appropriate consensus protocol based on the transaction type or action and then performing the necessary operations.

2. **Method: SelectConsensusProtocolForTransaction**:
   This method allows clients to choose the most suitable consensus protocol based on the type of transaction they want to perform. For example, different consensus protocols might be more suitable for regular transactions, reward transactions, or token exchange transactions. The method takes a `TransactionType` parameter that helps determine the appropriate consensus protocol to use.

3. **Method: TransferFunds**:
   This method enables clients to initiate a fund transfer operation using the selected consensus protocol. Clients provide sender and recipient addresses along with the amount to be transferred. The consensus protocol implementation handles the details of how the transfer is executed while adhering to the rules of the selected protocol.

4. **Method: ExecuteCustomAction**:
   This method allows clients to perform custom actions that might be specific to a certain consensus protocol or use case. The `ActionType` parameter helps define the nature of the custom action, and the associated data might be required to provide additional context for the action.

5. **Enums: TransactionType and ActionType**:
   These enums provide an organized way to categorize different types of transactions and actions. They enhance code readability and allow the methods to accept specific types in a more self-explanatory manner.

The `IConsensusContract` interface acts as a bridge between the higher-level client code and the lower-level implementations of various consensus protocols. It provides an abstraction layer that shields clients from the complexity of directly interacting with different consensus protocols while allowing them to utilize the capabilities of those protocols as needed.

Implementing the methods defined in this interface within your `ConsensusContract.cs` class will involve selecting the appropriate consensus protocol, delegating the task to the selected protocol, and returning the results back to the client. This architecture promotes modularity, extensibility, and maintainability by allowing you to add new consensus protocols or modify existing ones without affecting the client code that interacts with them.

/*
Certainly, let's delve deeper into the IConsensusContract.cs interface and its purpose within your project structure.

IConsensusContract.cs:

The IConsensusContract.cs interface serves as a contract that defines the methods or properties that clients (end-users or other parts of your application) will use to interact with different consensus protocols in your MyCryptoCoin application. This interface abstracts the details of how consensus protocols work and provides a standardized way for clients to select and utilize these protocols.

Key Points:

    Abstraction: The interface provides an abstraction layer that hides the implementation details of each consensus protocol. Clients can interact with the protocols through the methods defined in this interface without needing to understand the internal workings of each protocol.

    Flexibility: By defining a common set of methods in the interface, you allow clients to easily switch between different consensus protocols as their needs change. This flexibility is essential in a dynamic and evolving blockchain ecosystem.

    Extensibility: The interface can be extended to include additional methods or properties to support more advanced features or customization options related to consensus protocols.

    Centralized Management: The interface can be managed centrally, providing a clear and consistent way for clients to access and interact with various consensus protocols. This helps in maintaining a structured and organized codebase.

    Loose Coupling: The interface promotes loose coupling between the different parts of your application. Clients depend on the interface contract rather than the concrete implementations, which enhances modularity and simplifies testing.

    Documentation: The interface serves as documentation for how to use consensus protocols in your application. Developers can refer to this interface to understand the available methods and their purposes.

Example Method: SelectConsensusProtocol(string protocolName)

This method allows clients to select a specific consensus protocol by providing its name as an argument. The implementation of this method would involve the logic to instantiate and manage the chosen consensus protocol based on the given name.

Directory/Path for IConsensusContract.cs:

The IConsensusContract.cs interface should be placed within the appropriate namespace and directory that corresponds to your application's structure. Since it's a part of the consensus-related functionality, you can place it in the MyCryptoCoin/Consensus directory alongside other consensus-related classes.

Remember to keep your directory structure organized and intuitive so that developers can easily find and understand the purpose of each file.
