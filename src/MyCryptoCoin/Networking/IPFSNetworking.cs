// the IPFSNetworking class contains networking-related functionality specific to IPFS. It provides methods to connect to an IPFS node, send messages to the node, and disconnect from the node. The class uses the TcpClient class to establish and manage network connections. Please note that this is a simplified example for illustration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you might need to handle more complex network communication, error handling, and potential issues that could arise during networking interactions. Additionally, you might want to consider using asynchronous methods for better scalability and responsiveness in network operations.
