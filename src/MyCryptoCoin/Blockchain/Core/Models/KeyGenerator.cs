/*
The `KeyGenerator.cs` file contains the `KeyGenerator` class, which is a concrete implementation of the `IKeyGenerator` interface in the MyCryptoCoin blockchain project. The purpose of this class is to generate key pairs for cryptocurrency wallets using the RSA cryptographic algorithm.

**KeyGenerator Class:**

The `KeyGenerator` class implements the `IKeyGenerator` interface and provides the actual logic for generating key pairs. In this implementation, the RSA cryptographic algorithm is used to generate the key pairs.

**Methods of the KeyGenerator Class:**

1. **(string publicKey, string privateKey) GenerateKeyPair():**
   - Description: The `GenerateKeyPair` method is responsible for generating a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key using the RSA algorithm.
   - Return Type: The method returns a tuple containing two strings: the `publicKey` and the `privateKey` generated by the RSA algorithm.
   - Additional Functionality: The method uses the `RSACryptoServiceProvider` class from the `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace to generate the key pair. It creates a new instance of `RSACryptoServiceProvider` with a key size of 2048 bits, which is a common size for secure RSA key pairs. The generated public and private keys are then converted to Base64 strings before being returned as part of the tuple.

**Usage in the MyCryptoCoin Project:**

The `KeyGenerator` class is an essential component used in various parts of the MyCryptoCoin blockchain project, particularly in the wallet management components. When a new cryptocurrency wallet is created, the `KeyGenerator` class is called to generate a new key pair. The resulting public key is used as the wallet address, which can be shared publicly to receive funds. The private key, on the other hand, is stored securely by the wallet owner and used to sign transactions to prove ownership and authorization for spending the cryptocurrency in the wallet.

**Security Considerations:**

Generating secure and random key pairs is of utmost importance in blockchain-based systems, as the security of the entire network relies on the robustness of these keys. The RSA algorithm used in this implementation is a well-established and widely used cryptographic algorithm that provides a high level of security, especially with a key size of 2048 bits.

It is essential to protect the private key, as compromising it can lead to unauthorized access and the loss of funds stored in the associated wallet. For this reason, private keys are typically stored in secure hardware wallets or other secure key storage mechanisms.

**Additional Notes:**

- Cryptocurrency wallets in blockchain systems typically have one or more key pairs, with each key pair representing a unique wallet address and its corresponding private key.

- The `KeyGenerator` class adheres to the SOLID principles of software design by providing a clear and single responsibility for generating key pairs and implementing the defined contract in the `IKeyGenerator` interface.

- While the RSA algorithm is used in this implementation, there are other cryptographic algorithms like ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) that are also commonly used for generating key pairs in blockchain systems. The choice of the cryptographic algorithm may vary based on the project's requirements and the desired level of security.

- It is essential to keep the `KeyGenerator` class and the private keys secure within the blockchain infrastructure to prevent potential security breaches and unauthorized access to funds. Proper key management is crucial for the overall security and integrity of the blockchain system.
