// The IIPFS.cs file contains the IIPFS interface, which represents the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) in the MyCryptoCoin project. IPFS is a distributed file system that allows files to be stored and accessed in a decentralized manner using unique content-based addresses (hashes). This interface defines the core functionalities for interacting with the IPFS network. .The IIPFS interface defines methods for uploading and downloading files to/from an IPFS server, as well as pinning and unpinning files. It also includes properties to configure the IPFS server URL and port. This interface provides a contract that can be implemented by IPFS-related classes to interact with IPFS functionality in your application. Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific use case and requirements.

/*
Key Components of IIPFS Interface:

    AddFile(byte[] fileData):
        Parameters:
            fileData (byte[]): The data of the file to be added to the IPFS network.
        Return Type: string
        Description: The AddFile method is responsible for adding a file to the IPFS network. It takes the file data as input and returns a unique content-based hash that serves as the address for accessing the file on the IPFS network.

    GetFile(string fileHash):
        Parameters:
            fileHash (string): The unique hash of the file to be retrieved from the IPFS network.
        Return Type: byte[]
        Description: The GetFile method allows users to retrieve a file from the IPFS network using its unique content-based hash. It returns the file data as a byte array.

    FileExists(string fileHash):
        Parameters:
            fileHash (string): The unique hash of the file to be checked for existence on the IPFS network.
        Return Type: bool
        Description: The FileExists method checks if a file with a given hash exists on the IPFS network. It returns true if the file exists and false otherwise.

// Explanation: the methods defined in the `IIPFS` interface:

// 1. `UploadFileAsync(byte[] fileBytes)`: This method takes a byte array (`fileBytes`) representing the content of a file and uploads it to the IPFS server. It returns a task that can be awaited to get the resulting IPFS file ID.

// 2. `DownloadFileAsync(string fileId)`: This method takes an IPFS file ID (`fileId`) and downloads the corresponding file from the IPFS server. It returns a task that can be awaited to get the downloaded file's content as a byte array.

// 3. `PinFileAsync(string fileId)`: Pins a file in the IPFS network, ensuring that it is retained and accessible even if there are no direct references to it. It takes an IPFS file ID and returns a task that indicates whether the pinning operation was successful.

// 4. `UnpinFileAsync(string fileId)`: Unpins a previously pinned file, allowing the IPFS network to potentially remove it if no longer needed. It takes an IPFS file ID and returns a task that indicates whether the unpinning operation was successful.

// 5. `GetFileHashAsync(string fileId)`: Retrieves the hash of a file with the given IPFS file ID. It returns a task that can be awaited to get the file's hash.

// These methods and properties are designed to interact with an IPFS server, allowing your application to perform operations like uploading, downloading, pinning, and unpinning files, as well as retrieving file hashes and configuring the IPFS server connection. Keep in mind that this interface provides a high-level contract, and the actual implementation of these methods will involve interacting with the IPFS network and server based on the IPFS protocol specifications.

// Properties related to IPFS server configuration:

// 1. IPFSServerUrl: A property that allows you to set or get the URL of the IPFS server that your application should connect to.

// 2. IPFSPort: A property that allows you to set or get the port number on which the IPFS server is running.

// 3. IPFSBaseApiPath: A property that allows you to set or get the base API path for IPFS requests. This might be useful if your IPFS server has a specific API endpoint.

// 4. IPFSUsername: A property that allows you to set or get the username for authentication with the IPFS server, if authentication is required.

// 5. IPFSPassword: A property that allows you to set or get the password for authentication with the IPFS server, if authentication is required.

// 6. UseIPFSAuthentication: A property that allows you to enable or disable IPFS authentication. If set to true, the IPFSUsername and IPFSPassword properties will be used for authentication when communicating with the IPFS server. If set to false, no authentication will be used.

// These properties can be used to configure the connection to the IPFS server, making it more flexible and customizable for different deployment environments or use cases.

Additional Notes:

    The IIPFS interface provides a high-level view of the IPFS integration in the MyCryptoCoin project. It ensures that any IPFS implementation in the project adheres to a standard set of methods for adding and retrieving files from the IPFS network.

    Custom IPFS classes will implement the IIPFS interface to define how the IPFS integration interacts with the blockchain and other components of the MyCryptoCoin project.

    IPFS is a distributed file system that can be utilized to store various types of data, such as transaction information, smart contract code, and other blockchain-related content in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner.

    The IIPFS interface promotes modularity and interoperability, allowing the MyCryptoCoin project to seamlessly integrate with IPFS or other distributed file systems to enhance data storage and retrieval capabilities.

    The IIPFS interface provides an abstraction layer for IPFS integration, allowing different IPFS implementations to be used interchangeably within the MyCryptoCoin project. This promotes modularity and makes it easy to switch between IPFS implementations or adapt to future changes in the IPFS ecosystem.

    IPFS is known for its decentralized nature and content-based addressing, making it a suitable solution for storing large amounts of data and ensuring the availability and integrity of the content.

    In the context of the MyCryptoCoin project, IPFS can be leveraged to store various types of data, including transaction records, smart contract code, user profile information, and other blockchain-related content.

    Implementing the IIPFS interface facilitates seamless integration of IPFS with other components of the MyCryptoCoin ecosystem, such as the blockchain, transaction processing, and data storage, enhancing the project's overall functionality and decentralization.

/*
In this code snippet, the IIPFS interface is defined with three method signatures that represent the IPFS-related actions:

    AddFileAsync: A method that takes a file path as a parameter and returns a task representing the asynchronous addition of a file to the IPFS network. The method should return the CID of the added file.

    GetFileAsync: A method that takes a CID as a parameter and returns a task representing the asynchronous retrieval of a file from the IPFS network. The method should return a Stream containing the file data.

    ConfigureIPFS: A method that takes a gateway URL as a parameter and configures the IPFS gateway URL.

Implementing classes will need to provide concrete implementations for these methods to fulfill the contract specified by the IIPFS interface. This interface serves as a contract for IPFS functionality, ensuring that classes that implement it adhere to the specified method signatures and can be used interchangeably.
